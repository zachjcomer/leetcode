# My LeetCode Solutions
I didn't start using a repo until I was pretty far in with LeetCoding, but here's the solutions to the problems I've done since then. I try to keep everything to two sentences at most -- anything beyond that doesn't seem to be helpful.

If you NeetCode, I also place some of those problems into different categories because the NeetCode category suggestions are inaccurate in my opinion.

Hope these help someone, feel free to ask if you have questions.
